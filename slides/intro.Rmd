## Overview

1. How can we minimize mistakes in psychological science?
2. What does it mean to have a fully reproducible pipeline?
3. What is `git` and how can I use it?
4. What is `RMarkdown` and how can I use it?
5. Writing an APA-style paper that is fully reproducible.

# 1. How can we minimize mistakes in psychological science?

## Replicability Crisis

>- Failures to replicate [e.g. @Ebersole:etal:2016; @OpenScienceCollaboration:2015; @Wagenmakers:etal:2016b].
>- Fraud [@Bhattacharjee:2013].
>- Improbable findings have been published in top-tier journals [e.g. @Bem:2011].

<br>

## Proposed Solutions

>- Change the incentive structure [e.g., @Nosek:etal:2015; @Wagenmakers:etal:2012a].
>- Be transparent and open [e.g. @Rouder:2016; @Wicherts:etal:2011].
>- Change the statistical approach [e.g. @Benjamin:etal:2018; @Rouder:etal:2016c; @Erdfelder:2010]

- Change the incentive structure [e.g., @Nosek:etal:2015; @Wagenmakers:etal:2012a].
- Be transparent and open [e.g. @Rouder:2016; @Wicherts:etal:2011].

## Mistakes in Psychological Science

Sources of mistakes:

>- Errors when programming the experiment (e.g. randomization).
>- Equipment failure (e.g. responses are collected unreliably).
>- Lost data.
>- Errors when coding the analysis (e.g. with data cleaning).
>- Errors when reporting the analysis (e.g. typos).

<br>

## Lab Practices Under the Microscope

Think about your own experience:

>- Is there time pressure to collect data?
>- Are there checks for coding experiments/surveys?
>- Are there checks for running analyses?

<br>

## Consequences

>- Prevalence: Roughly half the publications in 30 years of literature contained at least one malformed statement of a statistical test [@Nuijten:etal:2016].
>- Bias: Simple mistakes tend to go in researchers’ preferred direction [@Gould:1996].
>- Persistent: Once in the literature mistakes are almost impossible to detect [@Rouder:etal:2019a].

## High-Reliability Organizations’ Principles for Avoiding Mistakes

>1. Sensitivity to operations: Focus on processes instead of outcomes.
>2. Preoccupation with failure: Look for ways to proactively anticipate and avoid mistakes, and take small mistakes seriously.
>3. Resilience in the face of failure and reluctance to simplify: In a resilient lab, when things go wrong --- and they will --- people talk about them, document them, and learn from them.
>4. Deference to expertise: Each lab member has certain expertise.

## From Principles to Practices

>a. Adopting a lab culture focused on learning from mistakes.
>b. Implementing radical computer automation.
>c. Standardizing organizational strategies across lab members.
>d. **Ensuring that statistical analyses are coded.**
>e. **Developing expanded manuscripts in which documentation of analyses is woven into the manuscript files.**

# 2. What does it mean to have a fully reproducible pipeline?

## Fully Reproducible

>- Reproducible analysis.
>- Reproducible graphs and tables.
>- Reproducible numbers in text.

## Who Can Reproduce When?

>- Ideal: [Code containerization](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-containerization-83ae53a709a6).
>- Minimal: Provide a list of packages and software needed (Open source!).
>- Utopian: "I will be able to fully reproduce my analysis by 2035."

## Tools for Reproducibility

`git`

>- Versioning tool for collaboratively working on a product.
>- Avoid retaining multiple versions of the same work product.
>- 'paper_final_final_B.docx'.
>- Tutorial: @Vuorre:Curley:2018.

`R Markdown`

>- Document format embedding code chunks into text documents.
>- Avoid copy-and-paste.
>- Book: [https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

## What I would like to show you about `git`

<div class="left-col">
* How to use a terminal

  + What is it?
  + What can it do?
* Set-up for your computer
  + GUI/terminal
  + R Studio & git
  + SSH
  + Set name & email address
</div>

<div class="left-col">
  + Your first repo
    - Github and GitLab

## What is it good for?

**Version control:**

>- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
>- History of all changes (who, what, when).
>- Helps to avoid mistakes (working on the wrong version, deleting, ...).
>- Merging changes of multiple collaborators in one file

## What is it?

## What can it do?

>- A lot! Which is why we only need a part of its functionality.
>- Working on one product in (large) teams.
>- Working on things that can break.
>- git can only integrate and show changes in text files.
>- binary files (images, etc.) can be tracked and uploaded but changes cannot be shown.
>- Track changes for MS Word is improving

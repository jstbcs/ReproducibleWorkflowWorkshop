# Git and Rmarkdown {.tabset .tabset-fade}

## Get to know git

1. Make a new repository.
2. Clone it using R Studio to make a local repository.
3. Write a (short) README file for your test repository using Markdown formatting.
4. Add your unstaged files, commit the changes, push to the remote repository.

## Branch out

Now it is time to make a development branch.

5. Open the terminal in Rstudio. Make sure you are in the right directory. Type:

```{r eval = F}
git checkout -b devel
```

This moves you to the new branch called devel. You can also see it in the git interface in Rstudio (typically top right  panel).

Now you are ready to go to work!

## Interact with git repositories and use rmarkdown

Now it is time to put your new knowledge on Rmarkdown and git to good use. 

6. Open a new Rmd file and save it in the git repository.

We will now use a data set from another repo for a simple analysis. This [repository](https://github.com/PerceptionCognitionLab/data0/tree/master/contexteffects/FlankerStroopSimon) contains data from several cognitive tasks. The [R-file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PerceptionCognitionLab/data0/master/contexteffects/FlankerStroopSimon/cleaning.R) in the repo loads and cleans the data.

7. Source the R-file from github directly. *Hint:* [Google is your best friend](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35720660/how-to-use-an-r-script-from-github)

You should now have the data set `stroop` loaded in R.

```{r echo = F, message = F}
devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PerceptionCognitionLab/data0/master/contexteffects/FlankerStroopSimon/cleaning.R")

head(stroop)
```

We want to analyze the response time (`rt`) as a function of condition (`cond`).

8. Conduct a paired t-test for the stroop task data.

*Hint 1:* You first need to aggregate the data.

*Hint 2:* This should be the results

```{r, echo = F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)

stroop_agg <- stroop %>%
  group_by(ID, cond) %>%
  summarize(mean_rt = mean(rt))

t.test(mean_rt ~ cond, data = stroop_agg, paired = T)
```

9. Make sure to knit your Rmarkdown document either to html or pdf.

## Back to git

When using branches it is easiest to work in the terminal.

10. Now add, commit, and push both the rmd file and the result file.

*Hint:* Use the terminal!

```{r eval = F}
git add myfile.Rmd myfile.html
git commit -am "my commit message"
git push --set-upstream origin devel
```

11. And then merge the `devel` branch into `master`:

```{r eval = F}
git checkout master
git merge devel --no-ff -m "merge devel"
git push
```

>- This is a workshop.
>- But it is short.
>- We will do some hands-on stuff but there is not a lot of time for practice.

# 1. How can we minimize mistakes in psychological science?

## Replicability Crisis

- Failures to replicate [e.g. @Ebersole:etal:2016; @OpenScienceCollaboration:2015; @Wagenmakers:etal:2016b].
- Fraud [@Bhattacharjee:2013].
- Improbable findings have been published in top-tier journals [e.g. @Bem:2011].

<br>

<br>

<img src="pics/bomb.jpg" width="200">

## Proposed Solutions

>- Change the incentive structure [e.g., @Nosek:etal:2015; @Wagenmakers:etal:2012a].
>- Be transparent and open [e.g. @Rouder:2016; @Wicherts:etal:2011].
>- Change the statistical approach [e.g. @Benjamin:etal:2018; @Rouder:etal:2016c; @Erdfelder:2010]

<br>

## Mistakes in Psychological Science

Sources of mistakes:

>- Errors when programming the experiment (e.g. randomization).
>- Equipment failure (e.g. responses are collected unreliably).
>- Lost data.
>- Errors when coding the analysis (e.g. with data cleaning).
>- Errors when reporting the analysis (e.g. typos).

<br>

<img src="pics/oops.jpg" width="200">

## Lab Practices Under the Microscope

Think about your own experience:

>- Is there time pressure to collect data?
>- Are there checks for coding experiments/surveys?
>- Are there checks for running analyses?

<br>

<img src="pics/lab.jpg" width="180">

## Consequences

>- Prevalence: Roughly half the publications in 30 years of literature contained at least one malformed statement of a statistical test [@Nuijten:etal:2016].
>- Bias: Simple mistakes tend to go in researchers’ preferred direction [@Gould:1996].
>- Persistence: Once in the literature mistakes are almost impossible to detect [@Rouder:etal:2019a].

## High-Reliability Organizations | Principles for Avoiding Mistakes

>1. Sensitivity to operations: Focus on processes instead of outcomes.
>2. Preoccupation with failure: Look for ways to proactively anticipate and avoid mistakes, and take small mistakes seriously.
>3. Resilience in the face of failure and reluctance to simplify: In a resilient lab, when things go wrong --- and they will --- people talk about them, document them, and learn from them.
>4. Deference to expertise: Each lab member has certain expertise.

<br>

## From Principles to Practices

>a. Adopting a lab culture focused on learning from mistakes.
>b. **Implementing radical computer automation.**
>c. Standardizing organizational strategies across lab members.
>d. **Ensuring that statistical analyses are coded.**
>e. Developing expanded manuscripts in which documentation of analyses is woven into the manuscript files.

# 2. What does it mean to have a fully reproducible pipeline?

## Science vs. Pseudo-Science

<blockquote>
“An article about computational results is advertising, not
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software
environment, code and data, that produced the result.” Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992
</blockquote>

## Fully Reproducible

>- Reproducible analysis.
>- Reproducible graphs and tables.
>- Reproducible numbers in text.

## Who Can Reproduce When?

>- Ideal: [Code containerization](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-containerization-83ae53a709a6).
>- Minimal: Provide a list of packages and software needed (Open source!).
>- Utopian: "I will be able to fully reproduce my analysis by 2035."

## A Tools for Reproducibility

`git`

>- Versioning tool for collaboratively working on a product.
>- Avoid retaining multiple versions of the same work product.
>- 'paper_final_final_B.docx'.
>- Tutorial: @Vuorre:Curley:2018.

# 3. What is `git` and how can I use it?

## What I would like to show you about `git`

<div class="left-col">
* How to use a terminal
* Git
  + What is it good for?
  + What is it?
  + What can it do?
* Set-up for your computer

  + R Studio & git
  + SSH
  + Set name & email address
</div>

<div class="left-col">
  + Your first repo
    - Github and GitLab
    - In R Studio
    - gitignore
    - README

* Workflow
  + Add, Commit, Push

## What is it good for?

**Version control:**

>- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
>- History of all changes (who, what, when).
>- Helps to avoid mistakes (working on the wrong version, deleting, ...).
>- Merging changes of multiple collaborators in one file.

## What is it?

<img src="pics/gitflow.jpeg" width="700" align="center">

## What can it do?

- A lot! Which is why we only need a part of its functionality.
- Working on one product in (large) teams.
- Working on things that can break.
- git can only integrate and show changes in text files.
- binary files (images, etc.) can be tracked and uploaded but changes cannot be shown.
- Track changes for MS Word is improving.

<br>

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
git add .gitignore myfirstrepo.Rproj

<br>

<br>

`git` can do autocomplete for file names!

## Git Commit

<br>

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
git add .gitignore myfirstrepo.Rproj

Congrats! You have done it! Now local and remote repositories are up to date!

## Task VI

- Add your unstaged files.
- Commit the changes.
- Push to the remote repository.

<br>

<img src="pics/do.png" width="220" align="right"> 

## Git Pull

Before you start working on the project the next time:

<br>

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
git pull
```

<br>

Pull, work some more, repeat.

## What changed since the last commit?

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
git diff
```

## What happens if something goes wrong? (And it will.)

- Remember: You cannot break things.
- Most likely you have a merge conflict.

## Push Conflict

>- Commit, and Push.

## Summary

>- Add, commit, push, pull.
>- Use it!
>- git documentation and error tracking are great!

# Using `git` for radically open data.

## Open Data

> - Standard: Data on request.
> - @Wicherts:etal:2006: Only 11 % of APA journal authors complied with initial request, an additional 16 % with repeated requests. A full 73 % of author teams never complied.
> - More and more: Data on OSF.
> - Needs to be hand-curated, only published when the paper is published.

## Born-open Data

> - @Rouder:2016
> - For people who are not meticulous.
> - Commitment to radically open data: You can see all data, even the failed pilots.
> - Nightly (or weekly) automatic upload to github.
> - github.com/PerceptionCognitionLab


## Born-open Data | Advantages

> - Increases awareness to make good decisions.
> - No data-management mistakes (no data versions).
> - Automatic backup.
> - Easy data sharing.
> - Long-term availability.

## Born-open Data | Elements

> - Shared local storage across experimental computers.
> - Git or Github repository.
> - Execution and scheduling

## Born-open Data | Elements

- Shared local storage across experimental computers.
- Git or Github repository.
- Execution and scheduling (task scheduler).

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
git add *.dat.*
git commit -m "automatic commit"
git push
```

## Born-open Data | Concerns

>- Not suitable for very large files (neuroimaging data, etc.).
>- Not a properly curated archive.
>- Github repositories can be connected to OSF.
>- Privacy concerns.
>- Being scooped.
>- Being vulnerable.
